On this project:
- Use an orm for the database
- Make this project super simple to transfer over eventually
- Make this project fully functional:
[] View Posts
- [] Use imgur for placeholder images next to books, generate the links in the backend and store in the database
[] Create Posts
  - book title & author; details; rating
  - AUTO: user that wrote it, date updated, date created
[] Delete Posts
  - make it have a date for post deleted in database
  - only show posts with the default NULL value in this row
[] Edit Posts
  - same ejs file as creating post
[] Delete book
  - deletes a book if no reviews are present for it
  - also a button to delete the book
[] Add user
[] Edit user
[] Delete User
**last:**
[] when adding a book, if thumbnail is not generated generate one from open library API
[] have a button to manually re-generate a thumbnail
- each time its pressed increase the .docs[0] then .docs[1] etc
[] instead of each review having a book tied to it, have like a book group with reviews inside of it like other project
